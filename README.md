# S-TranslAIt

## The Problem

Translating psychological scales for research, screening, and diagnosis is a tedious resource-intensive process that can take anywhere between a few months to several years. Some teams have already started to use LLM translations for internal and preliminary research. However, this process is not formalized, it is tedious to document, and requires a significant amount of manual labor. Furthermore, psychology researchers often lack the technical knowledge to fully exploit the capabilities of the available LLM technologies.

## The Solution

S-TranslAIt is an open-source web app that aims to streamline the process of translating psychological questionnaires using LLMs at scale.

## The Translation Method Design

The model will be centered around individual questionnaire items and will process them according to their type.
